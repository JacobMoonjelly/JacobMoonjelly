- 👋 Hi, I’m @JacobMoonjelly
- 👀 I’m interested in creating partnerships and communities to help protect and restore our Ocean.
I previously worked as a diving instructor for 7 years, in Egypt, Maldives and Thailand, where my connection to the ocean grew, along with my sense of urgency to protect it.

In the past 5 years I have been a part of starting a company called Paralenz, where we enabled divers to collect marine data for ocean science and conservation, by developing an under water action camera with built in sensors. (www.paralenz.com). In November 2020, i left Paralenz to pursue the vision of Moonjelly DAO.

- 🌱 I’m currently learning everything I can on DAOs and how we are able to organise and reward communities working towards a clearly defined and shared goal. Working on the Moonjelly DAO project is an amazing learning curve into working group organisation, rewards structures, tokenomics, governance procedures and much more, all for the sake of our Ocean. I moved from Denmark to Portugal in May 2021, to benefit from the strong ocean and blockchain community... and the great weather of course! 🌊🏄‍♂️

- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate through mutually beneficial partnerships, on anything web3 that could potentially benefit the Ocean.
